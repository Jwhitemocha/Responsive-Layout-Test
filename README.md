# Week2HW Responsive Portfolio

**Purpose**

Creating a fully responsive mock-up portfolio page, utilizing Bootstrap.

**HTML** 

Main wireframe of the page, using different divs to target certain elements with CSS

**CSS** 

Main source of design, boostrap gives nice simple options but I wanted to design the page a little further.
